WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/nn_ctrl_0/inst/start_signal is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/nn_ctrl_0/inst//i_/O, cell design_1_i/nn_ctrl_0/inst//i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
